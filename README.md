🏦 Loan Default Prediction

This project predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default or not using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on financial and demographic data, processed through various data preprocessing and feature engineering steps. A Random Forest Classifier is used to achieve accurate and reliable predictions.
